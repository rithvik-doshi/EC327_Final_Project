### Pemdas Calculator Module
The intention behind this program is to mimic the linear input that a normal calculator, like your average TI, takes in. This program works for a lot of simple calculations, but has the potential to solve multi-step arithmatic problems. However, the program currently fails with recognizing a negative number versus the subtraction operator (the latter is what the '-' sign is always recognized as). Therefore, this calculator will solve all calculations regarding positive numbers and only a few regarding some negative numbers. As this is a beta program, the next step toward ameliorating it would be to change the logic so that the '-' sign is just the negative sign, and affix it to the beginning of a number, then proceed to add the positive and negative number in the case of subtraction.

### UIMain
This program is the skeleton of our final project. It will allow users to interact with the three facets of our calculator: Pemdas, Graph and Matrix. Users initially open the main page, browse the options, and click on whichever button they wish. Each button takes them accordingly to a part of the application (certain objects are hidden and others are shown) where those individual features can be used. This is to be integrated with the rest of the project members' code.
