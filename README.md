# Line of best fit 

Foobar is a Python library for dealing with word pluralization.

## Scope

This application will allow you to find the line of best fit according to preference.
The application will only read from Comma Seperated Value (CSV) files and the user will select their
independent and dependent axis

## Usage

Many institutions, corportations, students and professors alike will come across data they need to
analyze via graphs and tables. Applications like MATLAB that allow you to do these operations with ease
are costly, and what we're trying to do is bring the main essense of data analysis into a simple app.

## Installation

```cpp
#include <Matrix.h>

```
