### Pemdas Calculator Module
The intention behind this program is to mimic the linear input that a normal calculator, like your average TI ,takes in. This program works for a lot of simple calculations, but has the potential to solve multi-step arithmatic problems. However, the program currently fails with recognizing a negative number versus the subtraction operator (the latter is what the '-' sign is always recognized as). Therefore, this calculator will solve all calculations regarding positive numbers and only a few regarding some negative numbers. As this is a beta program, the next step toward ameliorating it would be to change the logic so that the '-' sign is just the negative sign, and affix it to the beginning of a number, then proceed to add the positive and negative number in the case of subtraction.
