LECTURE MARCH 24TH
2:26, Enum events SFML
--pollEvent captures events. Boolean, param std::event

8:00 Image, Textures, Sprite

--make texture from image object
--Sprite is the dynamic image, just like karel

12:00 Keybind and Events

~15:00 Inheritance
--can use struct objects

--base class: animal
--derived class: cat
--Class is same as struct Except members are private instead of public
  struct base{ -- stuff in base class -- }
  struct Derived : (private/public/protected) Base { -- contains base--  }
  class AnotherBase {public:}
  class moreDerivated : (private/public/protected) AnotherBase{}

1:13:00 Operators
-- Color + Color, Color : Color
  use Color::operator+ (Color LHS, Color RHS){-- do something --}
  use Color::operator: (Color LHS, Color RHS){-- do something --}
1:18:00
-- cout << result << '\n'
  ostream& operator<<( ostream LHS, Color& RHS ) reference to original stream
-- cout << = operator<<(Type) and that it has Type: int, long, string, etc.
